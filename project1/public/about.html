      <p class="part1">We are an eccentric website and we focus on cute animals. 
        Our site has a variety of features that will allow you to slow down in your busy life and learn about the history of these adorable animals. 
        We hope that the growing attention will also help in the conservation of animals. Life doesn't stop, and neither does cuteness. 
        A harmonious society between humans and animals is being built.</p>
      
      <p class="part2">Each month we launch our top three cutest animals of the year for that month. 
        Every year in December we will launch our annual cutest animals. 
        And we will use the money raised during the year to help these animals through various activities. 
        Again you can click on the different screens to learn about an animal you like. 
        Underneath the cute appearance, there are also cute personalities, people and animals are the best partners!</p>

      <p class="part3">Our development projects include fundraising, conservation activities, 
        photography activities, cuddly animal documentation, cuddly animal poll, 
        cuddly animal ranking table. Details of the above will be updated on our website in the future. 
        Also, our website will provide you with detailed information about the cute animals, all of which have their own characteristics. 
        The cute appearance of these animals makes people happy and at the same time, they also become the support of human soul. 
        Accompanying the social progress of human beings to grow.</p>
